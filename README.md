# LOS Overlay & Cover Planner

Line-of-sight visualization with cover color-coding and bunker planning tools for RimWorld. Built using AI tools.

## Features

- **Three overlay modes**: Off, Static (direct LOS), Leaning (includes lean-around-corner)
- **Offensive/Defensive views**: See cover targets have from you, or cover you have from each direction
- **Cover color-coding**: Green (clear) to Red (heavy cover)
- **Pawn & turret gizmos**: Toggle overlay on drafted ranged pawns and player turrets
- **Planning tools** (architect menu): Place observer markers, hypothetical walls, cover, and openings
- **Combined view**: See union coverage from all observer markers simultaneously
- **Moving pawn tracking**: Overlay redraws as pawn moves to new cells
- **Combat Extended support**: Auto-detected soft dependency, uses cover height system
